F5 Distributed Cloud: Discovering & Securing API's
==================================================

Welcome
-------

In this lab, participants will explore the depths of F5 Web Application
and API Protection (WAAP) within F5 Distributed Cloud. Dive headfirst into
the cutting-edge world of API Discovery, uncovering what’s within, Sensitive Data
and Authentication State detection. Get hands-on experience as you unleash
the power of API Protection and API Rate Limiting.

Objective:
----------

-  Gain a deeper understanding of key F5 Distributed Cloud security functions and controls

-  Explore securing APIs through API Discovery and Protection, along with other controls within F5 Distributed Cloud

   -  **API Discovery**: Provided via machine-based learning processes, enables visualization of the API Framework,
      assesses use of end-points, discovers new end-points based on flows, identifies use of sensitive information,
      and enables swagger file export.

   -  **API Protection**: Encompasses a set of definitions and controls to protect and secure the functions, use and
      endpoints of the delivered API's framework.

   -  **Web Applcation Firewall**: Behaves as an intermediate proxy to inspect app requests and responses to block and mitigate a broad spectrum of risks via signatures and robust behavioral-based threat detection to protect applications wherever they are deployed.

   -  **Rate Limting**:  Defines parameters that can be used for fine-grained control over requests for a HTTP load-balancer that are subjected to rate-limiting using AI/ML learning engine to uniquely discover API endpoints used during service-to-service communication.

   -  **Malicious User Detection**: Provided via machine-based learning processes, enables malicious user behavior tracking by categorizing users into varying threat levels, allowing automatic or manual mitigation.

Lab & Tasks:
------------

-  All Lab requirements will be noted in the tasks that follow

-  Estimated completion time: 6 Labs approximately 15-20 minutes each
