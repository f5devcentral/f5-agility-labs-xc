Lab 6: Security Analytics and Malicious User Detection
=====================================

The Distributed Cloud (XC) platform has extensive logging and analytics capabilities.  Throughout this lab, we tested various
scenarios to explore how XC can protect and secure API endpoints. These requests and events are logged throughout the XC platform.
In this lab, we will explore the XC Analytics data observed from your scenarios. In addtion, we will explore Malicious User Detection & Mitigation.

F5 XC has the capability of indentifying and tracking user-sessions based on different parameters, such as: Client IP, TLS Fingerprint, Cookie value, 
HTTP Header value and many others.  These identifiers can track user behavior, allowing us to take action & make decision to block or challenge these
detected users.

**Expected Lab Time: 20 minutes**
