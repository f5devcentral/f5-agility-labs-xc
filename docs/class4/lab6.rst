Lab 6: Security Analytics and Malicious User Detection
======================================================

**Scenario**

A recent review highlighted the need for greater visibility into API performance and security events. 
This includes identifying bad actors (clients) attempting to misuse or attack the API.

Investigate request and security events, and establish a method for detecting malicious users.
