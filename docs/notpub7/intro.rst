F5 Distributed Cloud Application Threat Insight:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Account Takeover, Online Fraud, and Webscraping are a problem for many organizations.  Identifying unique devices accessing your web applications and understanding the relationship between those devices and users, accounts, and where those devices are accessing your site from can help identify suspicious activity.  Additionally, gaining visibility into what traffic is automated can quickly and drastically reduce unwanted and/or malicious activity.  

F5 Distributed Cloud (F5XC) Application Threat Insight provides a high-level overview of application traffic in two primary sections:
  
**Device Dashboard** - provides a high-level overview of devices accessing your web applications, including:
 - Count unique devices over time
 - Count of devices returning overtime
 - Session length per device
 - Device age (how long has this device been known)
 - ASNs per device
 - User-Agents per device.

**Bot Assessment** - provides a high-level overview of automated traffic to your web applications, including:
 - Percentage of human traffic versus bot traffic
 - Request timeline for human and bot traffic
 - Top ASNs sourcing suspected bot traffic
 - Top URLs accessed by suspected bots
