Lab: Introduction to Observability
====================================

Have you ever wished that you knew about impending application issues before your users or 
boss did?  Application performance issues or outages usually provide clues before they 
manifest into larger problems.  Synthetic monitors provides you the opportunity to often fix 
them before they become large-scale issues.
