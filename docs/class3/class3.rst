F5 Distributed Cloud: Security Automation & Zero Day Mitigation
===============================================================

Welcome
-------

In this lab, attendees will take a deeper dive into F5 Service Policies and Rate Limiting to provide application security.
Attendees will review Security Policy Frameworks, exercise configuration options, review security events
and perform hands-on configurations. Attendees will also explore rate limiting deployment configurations.  

**Narrative:** 
During the lab you will be playing the role of an Engineer at ACME Corp who is part of a team focused on building a zero trust
security framework through automation.  ACME Corp has concerns about zero-day attacks and are looking at a 
zero-trust program to ensure least privileged access while working to ensure low user friction.

**Goal:**
Implement and operate an application security environment utilizing F5 SaaS-Powered Distributed Cloud core security tooling. 

- Leverage F5 Distributed Cloud to enforce segmentation strategies at the edge to decrease
  attack surface

- Demonstrate the use of Service Policy frameworks for both negative and positive security models

- Utilize core solutions of Service Policies (geo/ip filtering, ip reputation filtering)

- Explore advanced Service Policy design using more extensive matching criteria (“custom rules”) to mitigate Zero-day 
  and automating those mitigations (speed to deploy Zero day) 


This Lab uses the **[AppWorld] F5XC Security Base Lab** UDF Blueprint.
