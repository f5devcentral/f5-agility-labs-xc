Lab 1 - Accessing F5 Distributed Cloud Console
==============================================

Welcome to this F5 Distributed Cloud Lab. The following tasks will guide you through the initial
access requirements for the associated lab environment.  Lab attendees should have received an
invitation email to the lab environment based on the submitted registration email.  Please check
email and spam folders if it has not been received.  If you have not received an email, please
contact a member of the lab team.

F5 Distributed Cloud Console, where this lab will be conducted, is a SaaS control-plane for
services that provides a UI and API for managing network, security, and compute services. The F5
Distributed Cloud Console can manage "sites" in existing on-premises data centers and sites in
AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments.

Course/Lab Invitation

**Exercise 2 - Explore F5 Distributed Cloud Console**

  .. NOTE::
     For the purposes of this lab, permissions have been restricted to lab operations. Some menus will be locked and not visible.

#. You can adjust your work domains and skill level (not required) by clicking on the **Account** icon in the top right of the screen and then clicking on **Account Settings**.

   .. image:: ../images/xclogonaccountsettings.png
      :width: 400pt

#. In the resulting window you can observe the **Work domains and skill level** section and other administrative functions.

#. Namespaces, which provide an environment for isolating configured applications or enforcing role-based
   access controls, are leveraged within the F5 Distributed Cloud Console.  For the purposes of this lab,
   each lab attendee has been provided a unique **namespace** which you will defaulted to (in terms of GUI navigation)
   for all tasks performed through the course of this lab.

#. Click on the **Select Service** in the left-hand navigation. In the resulting fly out navigation, click **Multi-Cloud App Connect**.

   .. image:: ../images/intro-008-updated.png
      :width: 400pt

#. In the **Multi-Cloud App Connect** configuration screen observe the URL. In the URI path, locate the **<adjective-animal>**
   namespace that you have been assigned. It will be located in the portion of the URI path
   between */namespaces/* and */sites/* as shown in this example **…/namespaces/<namespace>/sites/…**.
   Note the namespace as it will be used throughout the lab tasks that follow.

   .. image:: ../images/intro-009-updated.png
      :width: 400pt

#. Click on the **Select Service** navigation menu, then click the **DNS Management** tile.

   .. image:: ../images/xcconsoleclickdns-updated.png
      :width: 400pt

#. Please note the delegated domain name

   .. image:: ../images/xcconsoleclickdomain-updated.png
      :width: 400pt

   .. NOTE::
      - Your namespace name should captured/written down as it will be referenced later in the labs
      - A namespace is a Kubernetes construct. For more Kubernetes concepts, please review `Kubernetes Documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/>`_
      - The delegated Domain Name should be captured/written down, as it will be leveraged later in the lab.

**Beginning of Lab:**  You are now ready to begin the lab, Enjoy! Ask questions as needed.
