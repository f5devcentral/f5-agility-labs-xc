Lab 1 - Review vK8s Cluster and Deploy vK8s Workload
----------------------------------------------------

.. F5 Distributed Cloud App Stack is a SaaS-based offering to deploy, secure, and operate a fleet of applications across the distributed infrastructure in multi-cloud or edge. It can scale to a large number of clusters and locations with centralized orchestration, observability, and operations to reduce the complexity of managing a fleet of distributed clusters.

In this lab, we will learn the following:

•  Review the previously-created Virtual K8s cluster

•  Configure a vK8s workload utilizing a containerized app from a private registry

•  Deploy a vK8s workload within a vK8s site

•  Advertise a vK8s workload within a cluster via custom HTTP port

**Core concepts**

   *Workload*
      `Workload is used to configure and deploy a workload in Virtual Kubernetes. A workload may be part of an application. Workload encapsulates all the operational characteristics of Kubernetes workload, storage, and network objects (deployments, statefulsets, jobs, persistent volume claims, configmaps, secrets, and services) configuration, as well as configuration related to where the workload is deployed and how it is advertised using L7 or L4 load balancers. A workload can be one of simple service, service, stateful service or job. Services are long running workloads like web servers, databases, etc. Jobs are "run to completion" workloads. Services and jobs can be deployed on Regional Edges or customer sites. Services can be exposed in-cluster, on the Internet by L7 or L4 load balancer, or on sites using an advertise policy.`

   *Service*
      `A service with one or more containers with configurable number of replicas that can be deployed on a selection of Regional Edge sites or customer sites and advertised within the cluster where is it deployed, on the Internet, or on other sites using TCP or HTTP or HTTPS load balancer.`

   *Deploy*
      `Since Kubernetes is becoming the de-facto industry standard for orchestrating applications, F5® Distributed Cloud has chosen to implement its control plane with a Kubernetes compatible API for orchestration while delivering additional capabilities of managing and securing multiple clusters across distributed locations. This makes it seamless to integrate with third party tools like Spinnaker for CI/CD, etc. For packaging of microservices, we prefer Docker images, which have become another de-facto approach.`

**Exercise 1 - Review Virtual K8s Site**

#. Access **Distributed Apps** on the F5XC Console

   .. image:: ../images/1access_distributed_apps_service_menu-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Select **Applications -> Virtual K8s**, then your Virtual K8s cluster from the list

   .. image:: ../images/2access_applications_vk8s-udpated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Review **Sites** on the vK8s dashboard - there should be 3.  These 3 customer edge sites will be were our workloads will be deployed to.

**Exercise 2 - Configure vK8s Workload Container**

#. Select **Workloads** -> **Add vK8s workload**

   .. image:: ../images/4add_vk8s_workload-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Complete the **Metadata** section by using your Firstname initial and Lastname altogether and append “-workload” at the end. Ex: For Andrew Smith, the site name will be “asmith-workload” (without the quotes!) Use this value for **Name** and **Description**, then select **Service** from the **Select Type of Workload** list.

   .. image:: ../images/5workload_metadata_and_service-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Next, click the **Configure** link within the **Service** sub-section.

#. Select **Add Item** within the **Containers** section

   .. image:: ../images/6add_container-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Complete the **Container Configuration** section by providing a **Name** and details for which **Image to Use**

    - **Name**: f5xcdemoapp
    - **Image Name**: colemaneast.azurecr.io/f5xcdemoapp
    - **Container Registry**: Private Registry
    - **Private Registry**: shared/azure-registry

   .. image:: ../images/7container_config-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Click **Apply**

**Exercise 3 - Configure vK8s Workload Deployment Options**

#. Within the **Deploy Options** section, set **Where to Deploy the Workload** to *Customer Virtual Sites*, then click the **Configure** link within the **Customer Virtual Sites** section.

   .. image:: ../images/8deploy_options-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Select the appworld2025-k8s-vsite vK8s site name from **List of Customer Virtual Sites to Deploy**, then **Apply**.

   .. image:: ../images/9select_customer_site-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

**Exercise 4 - Configure vK8s Workload Advertisement Options**

#. Within the **Advertise Options** section, set **Options to Advertise the Workload** to *Advertise In Cluster*, then click the **Configure** link within the **Advertise in Cluster** section

   .. image:: ../images/10select_advertise_options-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. Within the **Select Port to Advertise** section, set **Select Port to Advertise** to *3000*, set **Application Protocol** to *HTTP*.  Finally click **Apply**.  This will set the clusterIP port to 3000.

      - **Port**: 3000
      - **Application Protocol**: HTTP

   .. image:: ../images/11set_advertise_port-updated.png
      :width: 600pt

#. With the vk8s workload configuration now completed, Click **Apply** again, then **Save and Exit** from the vK8s Workload configuration page

      :width: 600pt

   .. image:: ../images/11_c_vk8s_saveandexit_complete_config.png
      :width: 600pt

#. In less than a minute, you should see the workload added with 3 total sites and 3 total pods (you may need to click the "Refresh" button)
