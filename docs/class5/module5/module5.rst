Module 3: Deploy and Publish Managed k8s Application to the Internet
=============================================

In order to publish our application to the Internet we will need to first understand how Managed k8s is viewed in the UI and CLI and then create the managed k8s resources including namespace, deployment, and service.  

Once that is complete we can publish the application to the internet by creating the origin pool and an HTTP Load Balancer.
