Lab 1 - Explore F5 Distributed Cloud Console
--------------------------------------------

Welcome to F5 Distributed Cloud Application 301.

The following Exercises will guide you through the initial 
access requirements for this multi-part lab.  Lab attendees should have received an invitation 
(which requests you update your password for access) email to the lab environment. Please check 
the email address used for course registration and its associated spam folders to see if the
invitation email has been received.  If you have not received an email, please contact a member
of the lab team.
 
The F5 Distributed Cloud Console, where a majority of all lab tasks will be conducted, is a SaaS
based control-plane for services which provides a GUI and API for managing network, security, and
compute services. The F5 Distributed Cloud Console can manage "sites" in existing on-premises,
private data centers and sites within AWS, Azure, and GCP public cloud environments.


In this lab, we will learn the following:

•  Log into the F5 Distributed CLoud Console. 

•  Review account profile

•  Identify your namespace and your delegated domain name 


.. NOTE::
   - The delegated Domain Name should be captured/written down as it will be used later in the lab
   - Basic Kubernetes knowledge is recommended

**Core concepts**

   *Tenant*
      `Tenant is an entity that is the owner of a given set of configuration and infrastructure. Tenant is the owner of all 
      configuration objects that a user with given tenant-id has created. Tenant is the fundamental concept of isolation, and a 
      tenant cannot access any objects or infrastructure of other tenants.`

   *Namespaces*
      `Tenant’s configuration objects are grouped under namespaces. Namespaces can be thought of as administrative domains. 
      All the objects of the same kind need to have unique names in a given namespace. Namespace themselves must be unique 
      within a tenant. In this document namespace will be referred as <tenant>/<namespace>, which will be globally unique.`

   For more core concepts, please review `F5 Distributed Cloud documentation <https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/ves-concepts>`_

**Exercise 1 - Log into F5 Distributed Cloud Console**

.. NOTE::
   Once you join the UDF session, your UDF deployment will start and create an ephemeral account on the F5 Distributed Cloud console (this may take 5-10min)


#. Once your ephemeral account is created, you will receive an email to update your password. 

   .. image:: ../images/xclogonoemailupdatepass.png
      :width: 250pt

#. Upon the first login, you will be prompted to change your password.

   .. image:: ../images/xclogonopass.png
      :width: 250pt

#. After setting your login credentials, click login.

   .. image:: ../images/xclogon.png

#. Upon password update completion, you will be redirected to the F5 Distributed Cloud Console login. You will need to enter the lab tenant name *f5-xc-lab-app* and then click **Next**. Then enter your email and password and click **Log in**

.. NOTE::
   A tenant in the F5 Distributed Cloud console is a similar construct as an account in AWS or GCP terms.

#. You must click **Accept and Agree** to the terms.

#. Now, you will need to set the persona and the skill level to access the console.

#. Finally, navigate through the initial prompts.

**Exercise 2 - Explore F5 Distributed Cloud Console**

  .. NOTE::                                                                                    
     For the purposes of this lab, permissions have been restricted to lab operations. Some menus will be locked and not visible.

#. You can adjust your work domains and skill level (not required) by clicking on the **Account** icon in the top right of the screen and then clicking on **Account Settings**.

   .. image:: ../images/xclogonaccountsettings.png
      :width: 400pt                                                                                  

#. In the resulting window you can observe the **Work domains and skill level** section and other administrative functions.

  
#. Namespaces, which provide an environment for isolating configured applications or enforcing role-based 
   access controls, are leveraged within the F5 Distributed Cloud Console.  For the purposes of this lab, 
   each lab attendee has been provided a unique **namespace** which you will defaulted to (in terms of GUI navigation) 
   for all tasks performed through the course of this lab.                                                 
                                                                                              
#. Click on the **Select Service** in the left-hand navigation. In the resulting fly out navigation, click **Multi-Cloud App Connect**.    

   .. image:: ../images/intro-008-updated.png
      :width: 400pt                                                                                  
                                                                                            
#. In the **Multi-Cloud App Connect** configuration screen observe the URL. In the URI path, locate the **<adjective-animal>** 
   namespace that you have been assigned. It will be located in the portion of the URI path 
   between */namespaces/* and */sites/* as shown in this example **…/namespaces/<namespace>/sites/…**. 
   Note the namespace as it will be used throughout the lab tasks that follow.                                                     
                                                                                              
   .. image:: ../images/intro-009-updated.png
      :width: 400pt   

#. Click on the **Select Service** navigation menu, then click the **DNS Management** tile.

#. Please note the delegated domain name 

   .. image:: ../images/xcconsoleclickdomain-updated.png
      :width: 400pt

   .. NOTE::
      - Your namespace name should captured/written down as it will be referenced later in the labs
      - A namespace is a Kubernetes construct. For more Kubernetes concepts, please review `Kubernetes Documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/>`_     
      - The delegated Domain Name should be captured/written down, as it will be leveraged later in the lab.
