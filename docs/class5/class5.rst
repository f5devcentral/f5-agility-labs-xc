F5 Distributed Cloud - AppStack CaaS & K8s Delivery Options
===========================================================

This Lab environment highlights some of the basic concepts of F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) AppStack.

During the lab you will be emulating a customer that needs to deploy applications closer to the user. The goal is to understand the steps and requirements to place workloads in the F5 Distributed Cloud virtual Kubernetes implementation.

This class has 4 modules, each with at least 1 required lab. Some modules contain optional labs which are clearly denoted. We're simply doing this to show the standard structure of a class/module/lab.
